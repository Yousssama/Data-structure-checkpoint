      ARRAY

we first initialize the two sets of elements as arrays, and then create a new set called distinct_elements to hold all distinct elements. We then loop through each element in set1 and add each element to the distinct_elements set using the add method.

We then loop through each element in set2 and add each element to the distinct_elements set using the add method again. Since sets only contain distinct elements by definition, this ensures that we have a set of all the distinct elements from both sets.

Finally, we calculate the sum of all distinct elements in the distinct_elements set by looping through each element and adding it to a sum variable. We then output the sum of all distinct elements.

                   DOT PRODUCT

dot_product is defined as a procedure that takes two vectors v1 and v2 as input, calculates their dot product, and stores the result in the variable ps. The main algorithm then reads in n pairs of vectors, calls dot_product on each pair, and determines whether the vectors are orthogonal based on whether the dot product is zero.
